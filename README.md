# 🌾 Smart Crop Recommendation System  

The **Smart Crop Recommendation System** uses machine learning algorithms to recommend the most suitable crop based on soil and environmental conditions. It analyzes multiple parameters and predicts the ideal crop for maximizing yield.

---

## **🚀 Features**
- Implements multiple machine learning algorithms (KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, MLP, AdaBoost) for prediction.
- Conducts comprehensive **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on agricultural data.
- Provides model evaluation using metrics such as **accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report**.
- Built with a modular and clean pipeline for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

---

## **🛠️ Tech Stack**
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – data cleaning and manipulation  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – visualizations  
  - `scikit-learn` – machine learning models and evaluation  
- **Dataset:** `dataset.csv` (contains soil and environmental features with a `label` column indicating the crop)

## **📊 Workflow**
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Cleaning, normalization, and label encoding for target variables.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualizing feature distributions, correlations, and crop trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib.  
3. **Model Training:**  
   - Algorithms used: KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, MLP, AdaBoost.  
4. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Comparing models with **accuracy_score**, **classification_report**, and **confusion_matrix**.

---

## **📈 Results**
- Models achieve high accuracy (**> X%** — update with your highest accuracy).  
- **Random Forest** and **MLP** performed the best in terms of prediction accuracy.

---

## **📌 Future Enhancements**
- Deploy as a web application using Flask/Streamlit.  
- Add modules for fertilizer and yield prediction.  
- Integrate real-time weather and soil condition APIs.
